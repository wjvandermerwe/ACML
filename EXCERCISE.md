Lecture 1:

(1) Consider a 3-input perceptron with weights w1 = 2.5, w2 = −3, w3 = 1.5 and threshold
θ = 2.
Find the output of the perceptron for the following input vectors:
(a) x= (−1,2,4)
(b) x= (2,−1,−2)

(2) Using the perceptron in exercise (1), do one update of the weights w1,w2,w3 and thresh-
old θ as follows: Suppose the input vector x= (1,1,2) from your dataset has target
t = 0. When xis fed into the perceptron the output we get is y = 1, which differs from
the target t. Update all the weights and threshold using the rules in the Perceptron
Training Algorithm. Use η = 0.1.
